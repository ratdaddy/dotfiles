dotfiles
========

Dot files I use various places.

Now with [rcm](http://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/) support! Just clone this repo, [install rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm#installation), and run `rcm-install` (presumably from your home directory) to automagically get all the dotfile goodness.
